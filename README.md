### Bayesian Network Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the usage of various network-related packages for Bayesian network structure learning. Each file focuses on a specific package and includes illustrative examples and code snippets.


1. **pgmpy.ipynb**: Generate synthetic dataset based on a discrete networks and learn the Bayesian network structure from the dataset.
2. **networkx.ipynb**: Generate random Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
3. **bnlearn_r.ipynb**: Use r package "bnlearn" within a Python environment. Use semiconductor data as an example to learn Gaussian Bayesian network.
